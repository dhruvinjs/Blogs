## 5 Subfolders
Models
The models folder is where you define the structure of your data. It tells your application what kind of information to expect and how it should be stored in the database.

For example:

If you're making a "User" model, you'd define things like name, email, and password as parts of a user's data.
You can also add functions that help you do things like save or find users in the database.


Middleware
The middleware folder contains functions that act like a checkpoint before a request reaches the main part of your app (the controller).

For example:

It can check if a user is logged in before letting them access certain pages.
It can also log details about each request or check if the data sent is correct.

db:

Manages the connection to your database and stores related functions like setting up a database connection.
Example: A file in this folder could handle connecting to MySQL, MongoDB, or any other database system you're using.

controllers:

Contains functions that handle incoming requests and perform actions like fetching data, processing information, or returning responses.
Example: A UserController might handle actions like creating a user, updating user info, or deleting a user.


const fileStructure=require("fs")

const folders=['controllers','middleware','routes','utils','db','models']
folders.forEach((values)=>
{
    fileStructure.mkdir(`./src/${values}` ,{recursive:true}, err=> err ? console.error(err) : console.log("success"))
}

    path:'./.env'
})

const port=process.env.PORT
app.listen(port,()=>console.log(`Listening in ${port}`))
